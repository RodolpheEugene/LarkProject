To view the permissions of files do ls -l.

The permissions allow you to know what exactly the user, group, and the world have access to within that file.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To see symbols coorelated with the listed files, ls -F, the â€“F option appends a slash (/) to files that are directories, an asterisk to files that are executable, and an at sign (@) to files that are symbolic links. 

This allows you to have another way of finding out what kind of file it is without having to memorize the color differencing.
